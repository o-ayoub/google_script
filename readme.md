This is an example on how to save data in sheet using google script; 

HOW TO DO: 
1- you need to create a new sheet in google drive, 
2- add headers in first row
3- go to Tools => Script Editor => New Script
4- copy code from google_code.gs and past it
5- go to run => Run function => select setup
6- go to Publish => Deploy as web app, 
  for: Who has access to the app select Anyone, even anonymous; 
7- copy Current Wep app URL
8- past it to you index.html where you have ajax request to send; 


keep in mind: For form that you have, it need to have the same fields names as in sheet;
